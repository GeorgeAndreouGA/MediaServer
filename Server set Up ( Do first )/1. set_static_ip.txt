#  Static IP Configuration on Linux:

!! IMPORTANT !!

This method may vary depending on the Linux distribution you are using.
Please refer to the official documentation of your specific distribution for setting a static IP.
This is a general method for Debian-based systems using /etc/network/interfaces.

In a terminal ( the numbers are the commands ):

. Find your network interface and current IP address

1. ip a

a) Identify the interface that provides your internet connection (e.g., eth0, enp0s3).

b) Note the current IP address assigned to that interface. You will use this or another free IP address on your network.

. Edit the interfaces configuration file

2. sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

Add the following configuration (replace placeholders with your details):

auto <interface>
iface <interface> inet static
    address <static-ip-address>
    netmask <netmask>
    gateway <gateway-ip>
    dns-nameservers <primary-dns> <secondary-dns>

Replace <interface> with the name you found in step 1 (e.g., eth0).

Use a static IP address that is free and valid in your network.

Set the netmask according to your network class (e.g., 255.255.255.0 for a class C network).

The gateway is usually your routerâ€™s IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

For DNS servers, you can use your gateway IP as primary DNS and a public DNS like 8.8.8.8 as secondary.

Save and exit the editor (in nano: CTRL+O then ENTER, then CTRL+X).

. Restart the networking service to apply changes:

3. sudo systemctl restart networking

. Reboot the system to ensure everything loads properly:

4. sudo reboot

. Verify the static IP assignment after reboot:

5. ip a
