#  How to Set a Static IP via the Router (DHCP Reservation)

Log into your router

Look for something like “DHCP Reservation,” “Static Leases,” “Address Reservation.”, etc.....

Find its MAC address of your pi (on the Pi, run ip link and look for eth0 or wlan0) or check the router’s connected devices list.

Create a DHCP reservation

Assign the Pi a fixed IP address within your LAN range.

Map this IP to the Pi’s MAC address.

Save/apply changes on the router



. From pi restart the networking service to apply changes or reboot the system ( unplug and plug ):

3. sudo systemctl restart networking

. Reboot the system to ensure everything loads properly ( if not already reboot ) :

4. sudo reboot

. Verify the static IP assignment after reboot:

5. ip a




Why This is the Best Option ( instead of giving from the host itself ( prevends " floating IP " ) )

Centralized management

The router controls all IP assignments; easier to manage multiple devices.

Avoids IP conflicts

No risk of accidentally assigning an IP already used by another device.

Easy to change later

You can reassign IPs from the router without touching the device.

Works on all devices

Especially useful if you switch the OS or network settings — the Pi always gets the same IP.

No need to configure each device manually

Reduces human error and configuration complexity.

Compatible with DHCP

Devices still technically use DHCP; the “static” assignment is handled centrally.

!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! THE DEVICE WILL BE USING DHCP AND NOT STATIC
