SSH
 
. Install SSH

1. a) sudo apt install ssh , b) sudo systemctl start ssh , c) sudo systemctl enable ssh

You can now ssh to the server with the user that is not forced to sftp only. Meaning the first user you created when installed the os ( If you followed the SFTP guide )

1.1 In /etc/ssh/sshd_config set : " PermitRootLogin no " ( the root can't ssh ) and " PasswordAuthentication yes " the users can login with there password.
 
. Access the server ( the password will be the same for the user without the sftp only. )

2. ssh <name of the user that has no sftp access only>@<your static ip address> 


. For better security use a firewall ( ufw , see other documantation) , PAM and AllowUsers to the sshd_config file of ssh 

1. AllowUsers to the sshd_config ( IMPORTANT!!!!! AllowUsers must be BEFORE the " Match User <sftpuser> ..... " ( step 5.2 in the sftp.md )  ): 

 1.1 In  /etc/ssh/sshd_config at the buttom add :  AllowUsers username@private_ip    ( This will allow only the ip's you want to ssh to the user)  

2. firewall ( ufw , see other documantation)

3. PAM :
   
   3.1 : In /etc/ssh/sshd_config : UsePAM yes

   3.2 : In /etc/security/access.conf :
   
        + : username : private_ip or private_ip's      ( the + is to allow the username to be accessed only by the ip's you want )
        - : ALL : ALL   (THIS MUST BE AT THE END OF ALL OTHER USERS YOU'VE ADDED ABOVE)


     
   3.3 : In /etc/pam.d/sshd :   account required pam_access.so

   3.4   In /etc/pam.d/login : account required pam_access.so

sudo systemctl restart ssh
