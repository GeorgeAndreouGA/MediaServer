Install Vpn ( Access your home network with the services of your server from everywhere )

Install tailscale on linux server : 

1.go to tailscale and create an account 

2. add the linux server to tailscale account by selecting " linux "

3. copy paste the command that it will give you the the linux server terminal

4. on the tailscale site go to your linux server and disable " key expiry " ( do this for the clients also)

5. on the tailscale site go to settings -> device managment -> and enable " Device approval "

6. once installed we are going to configure the linux server to have " ip forwarding " 
in order to be able to to access our services using the "private_ip of the server" and not 
the virtual one that tailscale will give us . So in general we are going to " allow all traffic 
to pass trough tailscale " in order to access our LAN network ( we can access services that are not 
 on the server but also in our LAN e.g printer ,router webiste , ps4 remode play etc....)

7. if your Linux system has a /etc/sysctl.d directory, use:

   . echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf

   . sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
                
               Otherwise, use:

   . echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

   . sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf

 
 8. IF you are using ufw firewall :
    
   . sudo nano /etc/default/ufw   :   Find: DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="DROP" Change it to:    DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"

   . sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules : add this at the top (before the *filter rules):

               *nat
               :POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
               -A POSTROUTING -s 100.64.0.0/10 -o <your_network_interface> -j MASQUERADE
               COMMIT  
      
    !!!!IMPORTANT !!!! the 100.64.0.0/10 is the range of ips that tail scale gives !!! Don't change it 
  
   . In the samfe config file ( /etc/ufw/before.rules  )  add this after the  *filter rules: 
         
         -A FORWARD -i tailscale0 -o <your_network_interface> -j ACCEPT
         -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tailscale0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

    # check if applied ( you shoud see somthing like :  0     0 MASQUERADE  0    --  *      eth0    100.64.0.0/10        0.0.0.0/0)      
     sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v
   ##################################################
    
   . sudo ufw allow from 100.64.0.0/10 to any port <your services port proto <protocol>
    

   . sudo ufw reload


9.  UDP GRO forwarding  

    . sudo ethtool -K <your_network_interface> rx-udp-gro-forwarding on rx-gro-list off

    .  Get connection name: nmcli -t -f NAME,DEVICE connection show --active
                          
                            THEN 

         sudo nmcli connection modify "connection name " ethtool.feature-rx-udp-gro-forwarding on
         sudo nmcli connection modify "connection name " ethtool.feature-rx-gro-list off


    . restart : sudo nmcli connection down "connection name" && sudo nmcli connection up "connection name"
         
       Verify Settings
  

       . nmcli connection show "Wired connection 1" | grep ethtool

       . ethtool -k eth0 | grep -E "udp-gro-forwarding|gro-list"


10.    . sudo systemctl restart tailscaled
        
       . tailscale status


NOW WE'VE SUCCESSFULY ENABLED IP FORARDING.




next step we are enabling the " exit node " and " subnet route " : . tailscale up --advertise-exit-node --advertise-routes=< subnet of your server's private ip . e.g 192.168.10.0/24 >

go to the site and approve the 2 settings on the linux server.

IN THE TAILSCLAE SITE IT MITE SHOW A WARNING THAT IT IS NOT ENABLED . THE REASON IS THAT WE DID NOT DO IT FOR THE IPv6 . WE DON'T NEED IT 

In your nginx config you should allow the 100.64.0.0/10 ip range for every service for the vpn

DONE!!!


for the clients just install tailscale and once you've logged in to your tailscale account and approved them
you should the linux server as " exit node " 

DONE!!!!


IN THE SIDE DISABLE ALSO THE tailscale ssh . we don't need it because we can ssh through port 22
