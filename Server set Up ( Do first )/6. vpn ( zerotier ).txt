Install Vpn ( Access your home network with the services of your server from everywhere )

The easiest method to do it is by installing zerotier on both the server and the client devices. Otherwise you can try installing wireguard or openvpn

   Zerotier 

 1. curl -s https://install.zerotier.com | sudo bash
 2. sudo systemctl enable --now zerotier-one

 After creating an account and a network to zerotier ( https://www.zerotier.com/ )  you will have a network id for the network you created 

 3. sudo zerotier-cli join <your-network-id>

Now the server is on the network that you created.
Install zerotier on the client device and join the same network
On the server:

4. ip a

Now you will see another interface for zerotier with a virtual ip ( Better go to zerotier account and make tha ip of the server static )

On the client device you can access the server's services through that virtual ip of the zerotier interface 

It is best to route all the traffic of zerotier through the server so that the clients can access the whole network ( can access services not only of the server's wihtout the needing of the virtual ip )

. Enable IP Forwarding on the Server

5.  sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

   Uncomment or add: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   
6. sudo sysctl -p

. Set Up NAT on the Server

7. sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o < your network interface, not zerotier >  -j MASQUERADE
8. sudo apt install iptables-persistent -y
9. sudo netfilter-persistent save

.  Mark the Server as a ZeroTier Route Provider

    Go to https://my.zerotier.com, and:

    Open your ZeroTier network.

    Under Advanced > Managed Routes, add:

    0.0.0.0/0 via <zerotier server ip not actual server ip>

   Before the client connects make sure that it allows to route all the traffic through zerotier
