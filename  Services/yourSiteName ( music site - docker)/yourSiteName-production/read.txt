unzip the .tar to install the image ( create the .tar
from the development with " docker save -o yourName.tar yourName:latest " and move it folder of the production) : docker load -i  yourName.tar

change the values of the .env and see the .yml file

get the container up and running: docker compose up -d

i can't upload the .tar because github won't let me
