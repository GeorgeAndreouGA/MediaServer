This is a retro music website running in a docker container. we have :

yourSiteName-development = It has the all the files of the code and the files for docker so that you can build the container yourself 




Like our other services it runs on localhost so we use nginx for the domain 

in the .env you MUST insert a hashed password to access the admin panel so use the " generate-hash.js " ( set the username for the amdin panel also ) 


THE PERMITIONS OF THE FOLDERS MUST BE 755 AND FOR THE FILES 644 both inside and outside ( host ) of the container


In order to access the Admin panel , sinse it is on port 3003 and not in the public we have to put it on /etc/hosts in order to access the panell or if to your local dns .
BE CAREFULL if you add it tou your /etc/hosts when you are out of your network and want to access the PUBLIC interface you have to remove it from the /etc/hosts sinse is going to
be pointing to the server's ip address . Though if you have a local dns ( pi-hole) you won't have to do that
