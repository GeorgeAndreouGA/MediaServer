This is a retro music website running in a docker container. we have :

yourSiteName-development = It has the all the files of the code and the files for docker so that you can build the container yourself 

yourSiteName-production = it has the latest image from the production version in a .tar file ( create the .tar from the development with " docker save -o yourName.tar yourName:latest " ). So you just " docker load -i  echoriftsounds.tar " and the image is installed.
                          Then you can change the .yml file for the "yourName" and set the veriables in the .env . Then just " docker compose up -d " and access the 
                          client site from : yourdomain   and the amdin panel form : yourdomain:3003/admin ( see the nginx config )


Like our other services it runs on localhost so we use nginx for the domain 

in the .env you MUST insert a hashed password to access the admin panel so use the " generate-hash.js " ( set the username for the amdin panel also ) 


IF THE IMAGE IS LOST YOU WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE SORCE ( yourSiteName-development ) TO REBUILD EVERYTHING. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR IMAGE .TAR with
" docker save -o yourName.tar yourName:latest " after you 've  " docker compose up -d " ( this is for the yourSiteName-development). after that you " docker load -i  yourName.tar "



you don't need the development to run the site . you can use the production that will bulid the container and have already the source code inside it . i am just also giving you 
the production so that you can understant HOW TO BUILD A CONTAINER .



THE PERMITIONS OF THE FOLDERS MUST BE 755 AND FOR THE FILES 644 both inside and outside ( host ) of the container
